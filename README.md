# OpenProject Plugin Testing with Github Actions

Reusable github actions to be used with https://github.com/bitcrowd/openproject-proto_plugin/.

## Usage

To run these github actions, you need to update `test.yml` in the .github/workflows (in the plugin) with your plugin name. See the `DOCKER.md` in docker/ci for more information.
